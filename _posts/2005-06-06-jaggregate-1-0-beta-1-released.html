<p><a href="http://jaggregate.sourceforge.net">Jaggregate</a> is my attempt at implementing a Smalltalk-ish collections library in Java 5.&nbsp; I'd have been interested to see what Nutmeg looked like back in the day; but I can't find it anywhere on the web...the <a href="http://www.thoughtinc.com/">Thought Inc.</a> pages seem to be all about <a href="http://www.thoughtinc.com/cber_index.html">CocoBase</a>.&nbsp; Anyhow, I hope you'll have a look...I'd appreciate the feedback!</p>
