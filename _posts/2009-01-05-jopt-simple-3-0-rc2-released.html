<p><a href="http://jopt-simple.sourceforge.net">JOpt Simple</a> is my Java library for parsing command-line options. For 3.0-rc2, I&#39;ve overhauled the example page quite a bit, so that hopefully the capabilities of the library and the option syntax it supports are clearer. I welcome all constructive feedback.</p>
