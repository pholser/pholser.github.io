<p>A colleague introduced me to a terrific game called Set.&nbsp; Like most great games, it contains simple elements that combine to create a compelling play experience.</p>

<p>The game consists of eighty-one (3^4) cards.&nbsp; Each unique card has one, two or three shapes; the shapes are diamonds, squiggles, or ovals; the shading of the shapes is open, striped, or solid; and the colors of the shapes are green, red, or purple.&nbsp; The object of the game is to identify sets of three cards in which each of the four characteristics listed above are all the same in the set, or all different in the set.</p>

<p>More description and a daily Set puzzle can be found <a href="http://setgame.com">here</a>.&nbsp; I've had great fun doing the daily puzzle, and recently ordered the game itself for play at home with the family.&nbsp; Let me know how your Set experience goes!</p>
