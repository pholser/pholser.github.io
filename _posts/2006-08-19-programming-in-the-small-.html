<p>I've really enjoyed reading Ivan Moore's <a href="http://ivan.truemesh.com/archives/cat_programming_in_the_small.html">Programming in the Small</a> series. Lots of really nifty observations on how to improve your code a little bit at a time. My favorite quote thus far:</p>

<blockquote><pre>&nbsp; &nbsp; 	public boolean isWhatever() {<br />		if ( someCondition() == true ) {<br />			return true;<br />		} else {<br />			return false;<br />		}<br />	}</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Must control fist of death.</p></blockquote>
