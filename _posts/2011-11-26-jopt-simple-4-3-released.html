<p><a href="http://pholser.github.com/jopt-simple">JOpt Simple</a> is my Java library for parsing command line options. You can find the changes in this latest release <a href="http://pholser.github.com/jopt-simple/changes.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>This release incorporates a small API change to produce a list of OptionSpecs that correspond to the options detected on a parse, in the order in which the options occurred on the command line.</p>

<p>Happy parsing!</p>
