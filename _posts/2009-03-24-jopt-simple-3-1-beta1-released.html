<p><a href="http://jopt-simple.sourceforge.net">JOpt Simple</a> is my Java library for parsing command-line options. Version 3.1 adds the ability to convert arguments of options to Java types via converter objects. These are useful for types that do not meet the requirements of <a href="http://jopt-simple.sourceforge.net/apidocs/joptsimple/ArgumentAcceptingOptionSpec.html#ofType%28java.lang.Class%29">ArgumentAcceptingOptionSpec#ofType()</a>, or for which you might want to do things like regex matching before passing the values along unchanged. Check out the new classes in package joptsimple.util for some examples. Have a look-see and let me know what you think.</p>
