<p><a href="http://jopt-simple.sourceforge.net/">JOpt Simple</a> is my
simple, test-driven command line options parser library for Java.&nbsp; It
aims to support the rules of POSIX getopt() and GNU getopt_long(). 
There are plenty of libraries that perform this task, but I think
you'll find that JOpt Simple holds up very well against them in ease of
use, simplicity, and design.&nbsp; I would love to hear your feedback on
this library!</p>
