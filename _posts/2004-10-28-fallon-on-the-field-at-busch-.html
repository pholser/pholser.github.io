<p>Anyone else catch a glimpse on the Fox World Series broadcast of Jimmy Fallon, formerly of "Saturday Night Live", celebrating on the field with the Red Sox after they clinched?  Possibly mugging down with some woman?  Was it for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332047/">"Fever Pitch"</a>, his upcoming flick?</p>
