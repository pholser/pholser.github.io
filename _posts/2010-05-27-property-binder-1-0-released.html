<p><a href="http://pholser.com/software/property-binder">Property Binder</a> is a Java library that provides typed access to entries in properties files. It offers such access by allowing a programmer to provide it a Java interface whose methods represent the 
keys of the properties file. The methods can be annotated to indicate what property the method represents, what default value(s) it should assume if the property is not present, and what pattern separates the individual values of multi-valued properties.</p>
