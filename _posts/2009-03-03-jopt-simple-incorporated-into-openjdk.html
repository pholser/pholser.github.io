<p>Via email from <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/mreinhold/">Mark Reinhold</a>, Principal Engineer at <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a> -- it appears that <a href="http://jopt-simple.sourceforge.net">JOpt Simple</a> is being used for some of the command line tools in the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a>:</p>
<p>&quot;I thought you might be interested to know that we&#39;re using your jopt-simple library in the open-source Java Development Kit. Thanks for writing such a nice little library! &#0160;It&#39;s far cleaner than any of the other alternatives out there.&quot;</p>
<p>Great feedback! If you need to parse command line options with a minimum of fuss, please check out <a href="http://jopt-simple.sourceforge.net/download.html">JOpt Simple 3.0</a>. I look forward to even more widespread adoption of the library.</p>
