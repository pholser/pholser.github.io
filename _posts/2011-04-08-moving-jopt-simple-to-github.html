<p>Repo is <a href="https://github.com/pholser/jopt-simple">here</a>. I didn't carry <a href="http://jopt-simple.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jopt-simple/">previous CVS history</a> with me. Currently toying with the idea of allowing alternative help formatters for a next release. Will move website at some point also.</p>
