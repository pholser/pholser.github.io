<p><a href="http://pholser.github.com/jopt-simple">JOpt Simple</a> is my Java library for parsing command line options. You can find the changes in this latest release <a href="http://pholser.github.com/jopt-simple/changes.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I'm pleased to have received community contributions since moving the project to <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. This release incorporates some of those contributions.</p>

<p>Happy parsing!</p>
