<p><a href="http://sf.net/projects/jopt-simple">JOpt Simple</a> is my crack at command line option parsing.&nbsp; It is the offical version of my <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~pholser/software/pholser-getopts.zip">&quot;getopts&quot; TDD experiment</a>.&nbsp; I implemented it TDD-style, and it felt great.&nbsp; Realistically, the software is beta-quality, but I need to get a bunch of stuff done before I declare a release -- proper web site and docs, mostly.&nbsp; I'm proud of the code.&nbsp; It supports the option syntax of POSIX getopt() and GNU getopt_long(). I thought I'd take a crack at this despite the existence of other libraries, because I found the code of the other projects to be unnecessarily gnarly, and containing features I didn't think belonged (type conversion on option arguments, for one).</p>

<p><a href="http://sf.net/projects/jaggregate">Jaggregate</a> is a collections library modeled after the ANSI Smalltalk collections protocols.&nbsp; It is unapologetically J2SE 5 only.&nbsp; It is a means to support my learning of Java generics and other J2SE 5 Java language features, and hopefully will grow in popularity and use.&nbsp; I have dictionaries, sets, and bags ready--am working on the sequences now.&nbsp; I probably could use more tests.</p>

<p>Please check out the code.&nbsp; I'd love to hear suggestions and feedback.&nbsp; I'm also fishing for better names for these projects--they kind of felt like a give-up when I named them.</p>
