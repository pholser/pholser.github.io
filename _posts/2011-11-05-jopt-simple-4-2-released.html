<p><a href="http://pholser.github.com/jopt-simple">JOpt Simple</a> is my Java library for parsing command line options. You can find the changes in this latest release <a href="http://pholser.github.com/jopt-simple/changes.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>This release incorporates a small API change to allow compile-time arrays as the supplier of default values for an argument-accepting option, as well as removing some internal unused methods and classes.</p>

<p>Happy parsing!</p>
