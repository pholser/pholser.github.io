<p><a href="http://jopt-simple.sourceforge.net">JOpt Simple</a> is my Java library for parsing command-line options. Release 3.0.1 has no new features, but fixes a dependency problem for <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> users, so that by declaring a Maven dependency on jopt-simple, you don&#39;t end up pulling down <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> and the transitive closure of its dependencies.</p>
