<p>I attended <a href="http://citconf.com">CITCON</a> North America in Denver this weekend.&nbsp; I went to last year's North American offering in Dallas/Fort Worth (my turf) and had a great time, learned a lot, and met some really smart, passionate software professionals.&nbsp; Second verse -- same as the first.&nbsp; </p>

<p>CITCON (pronounced KIT-kon) attracts a number of thought leaders in the areas of continuous integration, testing, and agile methods.&nbsp; The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space</a> format means that participants get out of the conference what they put into it -- they create their own agenda.&nbsp; So I, along with the other attendees, proposed topics to fits into one of five different time slots in one of five different conference rooms.</p>

<p>The sessions I attended:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://openqa.org/selenium">Selenium</a> vs. <a href="http://wtr.rubyforge.org/">Watir</a> -- Good discussion around the relative merits, pain points, and constraints of these two open-source web testing tools.</li>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development">BDD</a> vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> -- The motivations behind moving toward behavior-driven development and lingo as opposed to the more developer-facing TDD counterparts.</li>

<li>Test-Driven Web Development -- Discussion around what a more test-centric approach to creating complex web applications might look like.</li>

<li>Continuous Testing -- My colleague <a href="http://www.benrady.com/">Ben Rady</a> gave a great demo of his <a href="http://code.google.com/p/infinitest/">Infinitest</a> tool.</li>

<li>A session about DSLs for testing and executable specifications.&nbsp; Good talk about <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> and <a href="http://www.easyb.org">easyb,</a> featuring <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/">Andy Glover</a> and another colleague of mine, <a href="http://www.rodcoffin.com/">Rod Coffin</a>.</li></ul>

<p>I actually put the &quot;Law of Two Feet&quot; to good use after a session I kicked off had run its course after about forty minutes.&nbsp; 8^)</p>

<p>As a software professional, you owe it to yourself to attend this conference.</p>
