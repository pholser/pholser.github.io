title: CHECKSTYLE:OFF comments are still apologies

<p><a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net">Checkstyle</a> is a fantastic tool to help Java development teams keep code clean and unsurprising. The feedback it gives should be treated as suggestions from a trusted advisor, not a nuisance. If I write a method that's getting a bit long-winded or overly complex, I'd like to know, so that I have an opportunity to make it easier to understand and maintain. I don't ever want to be "that guy" on my development teams -- leaving messes for others to wade through and clean up, slowing them down in the process. (Every once in a while, to my shame, I have been.)</p>

<p>Checkstyle allows you to exempt sections of code from the checks it performs by enclosing the section in special comments:</p>

<p><pre><code>
// CHECKSTYLE:OFF
    /* mess here */
// CHECKSTYLE:ON
</code></pre></p>

<p>There are times where such selective overriding of style checks is appropriate.  Here's an example from something I worked on recently:</p>

<p><pre><code>
abstract class ExceptionLoggingCallable&lt;V&gt; implements Callable&lt;V&gt; {
    // ...

    // CHECKSTYLE:OFF -- We advertise Exception because the method we implement does,
    // and because we want Exceptions in general to be rethrown.  We catch Exception
    // and Throwable in order to log them and rethrow.
    public final V call() throws Exception {
        try {
            return doSomethingThatMightRaiseAnException();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            logger.error(ex);
            throw ex;
        } catch (Throwable ex) {
            logger.fatal(ex);
            throw new RuntimeException(ex);
        }
    }
    // CHECKSTYLE:ON

    protected abstract V doSomethingThatMightRaiseAnException();
}
</code></pre></p>

<p>I specifically chose to subvert the <code>IllegalCatch</code> and <code>IllegalThrows</code> checks here for what I believed to be legitimate reasons. I gave those reasons in the <code>CHECKSTYLE:OFF</code> comments, so that readers would know it was not a lightly-taken decision.</p>

<p>Now consider the following code. Do you believe the Checkstyle checks are subverted for good reason?</p>

<p><pre><code>
    // CHECKSTYLE:OFF
    private void startLateCount(String localName, Attributes attributes) {
        if ("_LATE_COUNT".equals(localName) && currentLiability != null) {            
            int timesThirtyDaysLate = 0;
            try
            {
                String thirtyDayAttr = attributes.getValue("_30Days");
                timesThirtyDaysLate = timesThirtyDaysLate + Integer.parseInt(thirtyDayAttr);                
            }
            catch ( NumberFormatException nfe ) {
                
            }
            
            try
            {
                String sixtyDayAttr = attributes.getValue("_60Days");
                timesThirtyDaysLate = timesThirtyDaysLate + (Integer.parseInt(sixtyDayAttr) * 2);                
            }
            catch ( NumberFormatException nfe ) {
                
            }
            
            try
            {
                String ninetyDayAttr = attributes.getValue("_90Days");
                timesThirtyDaysLate = timesThirtyDaysLate + (Integer.parseInt(ninetyDayAttr) * 3);                
            }
            catch ( NumberFormatException nfe ) {
                
            }
            currentLiability.setMonthsDelinquent(timesThirtyDaysLate);
        }
    }
    // CHECKSTYLE:ON
</code></pre></p>

<p>My Checkstyle configuration caught brace-placement and empty <code>catch</code> block issues here -- but a cursory glance at the code should reveal a duplication of structure that is begging to be factored out.</p>

<p>Do not use <code>CHECKSTYLE:OFF</code> as a cloaking device that allows bad code to exist in the system undetected by tools. Use it as an <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.TimOttinger.ApologizeIncode">apology</a> for not being able to express the computation without breaking "the rules". If you must exempt some code from Checkstyle, explain why. If you see code snippets that are <code>CHECKSTYLE:OFF</code>'ed, ask yourself whether the reasons are legitimate, and if they aren't, refactor until the structure is improved and the intent clarified.</p>

<p>Same goes for any other static analysis tools that are there to help you, not annoy you.</p>
