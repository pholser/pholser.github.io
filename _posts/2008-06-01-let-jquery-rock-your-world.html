Recently at work we found ourselves needing to act on groups of table cells in an HTML page which shared a common class attribute value. After a couple of minutes of hemming and hawing about what a whipping the by-hand JavaScript DOM code would be to write, I heard faint echoes of how great <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> was at eliminating that whipping.&#0160; Sure enough, in another couple of minutes, after downloading the library and perusing the docs a bit, we got done the task we wanted to: turn spans within cells attributed a particular way into anchors.<br /><br />If you do any JavaScript programming, you owe yourself a swim through jQuery. Perhaps your world will be rocked like mine has the past few weeks.<br />
