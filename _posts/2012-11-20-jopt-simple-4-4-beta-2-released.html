title: JOpt Simple 4.4 beta 2 released
published: 1
---
<p><a href="http://pholser.github.com/jopt-simple">JOpt Simple</a> is my Java library for parsing command line options. You can find the changes in this latest release <a href="http://pholser.github.com/jopt-simple/changes.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>This release incorporates a number of smaller features and bug fixes, many of which were originated by users.</p>

<p>Please disregard 4.4 beta 1 -- I made a mistake while building and tagging it, and rather than try to undo a Git tag, I figured I'd just cut 4.4 beta 2 instead.</p>

<p>Happy parsing!</p>
