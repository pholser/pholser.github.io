<p><a href="http://jopt-simple.sourceforge.net">JOptSimple</a> is my Java library for parsing command line options. Release 2.4.1 fixes a bug with the new help screen generation changes. Thanks to Hans Dockter for reporting it. As usual, download instructions are available at the project&#39;s website.</p>
