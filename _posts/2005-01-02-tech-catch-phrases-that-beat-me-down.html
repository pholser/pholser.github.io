<p>A committee at <a href="http://www.lssu.edu">Lake Superior State University</a> in Michigan publishes a list of overused words and phrases every year.&nbsp; On <a href="http://www.lssu.edu/banished/current.php">this year's list</a> are &quot;battleground state,&quot; &quot;...and I approve this message,&quot; and &quot;carbs,&quot; among others.&nbsp; It got me thinking about some of the things I hear in my work as a software developer that beat me down.&nbsp; Here are a few:</p>

<ul><li><p><em><strong>Orders of magnitude.&nbsp; </strong></em>Just a fancy way of saying tenfold/hundredfold/thousandfold/...</p></li></ul>

<ul><li><em><strong>Works on my machine</strong></em> (or <em><strong>WOMM</strong></em>).&nbsp; The least helpful thing you can say to someone struggling to get a software application to work on <em>their</em> machine.</li>

<li><em><strong>It works</strong></em>.&nbsp; Oh yeah?&nbsp; Show me your tests, running, quickly, all green.&nbsp; Can I look at your code and understand it readily?&nbsp; Is the design well-factored, loosely coupled, cohesive, coherent?&nbsp; Would you be proud to show the code you wrote at a job interview?&nbsp; On what basis?</li>

<li><em><strong>It doesn't work</strong></em>.&nbsp; Oh yeah?&nbsp; Under what circumstances?&nbsp; What specific steps can I follow to reproduce the issue, if any?&nbsp; What is the expected behavior?&nbsp; If I understand these things, then I can write an automated test to expose the fault, then fix the code, then never have to worry about that problem again, ever.&nbsp; Without these things, I've very little hope of solving the problem.</li></ul>

<p>What are some of your tech-phrase beat-downs?</p>
