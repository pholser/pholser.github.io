<p>&quot;The Layperson's Guide to Building a Better User Experience&quot; -- in short, you are a user experience designer; take interaction design, user experience, and user personae seriously; and read up.</p>

<p>&quot;Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist&quot; -- Interesting discussion from the chief scientist of TopQuadrant.&nbsp; Interesting mention of D2RQ, a library to expose relational stores as stores of RDF triples; though to hear Dean Allemang tell it, there isn't much of a community forming around D2RQ.</p>

<p>Neat presentation from two Jython commiters about the challenges involved in compiling Jython code down to JVM bytecode.</p>

<p>Two Selenium cognoscenti, Dan Fabulich and Patrick Lightbody, gave a decent account of Selenium for web testing.&nbsp; Apparently the XPath support library that Selenium uses has been tuned quite a bit and should be faster in the new 1.0 beta.&nbsp; Still holding out hope that it can handle non-trivial (and even some trivial) XPath expressions on IE.</p>
