<p><a href="http://jopt-simple.sourceforge.net">JOpt Simple</a> is my Java library for parsing command-line options.&#0160; Release 3.0 will abandon support for pre-Java-5 JDKs, in favor of the new more typesafe ways of retrieving arguments of command line options. I will continue to support the 2.x line of development as needed. Give JOpt Simple&#39;s new look a test drive, and let me know what can be improved.</p>
