<p>I cooked up a toy Java 5 class that generates warnings of the &quot;unchecked&quot; family when compiled:</p>
<pre>
package pholser.util;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Stack&lt;T&gt; {
    private final Object[] storage;
    private int top;

    public Stack() {
        this.storage = new Object[ 5 ];
    }

    public Stack( final Stack&lt;T&gt; other ) {
        this.storage = (Object[]) other.storage.clone();
        this.top = other.top;
        final T currentTop = (T) storage[ top ];
    }

    public void push( final T item ) {
        checkPrecondition( isFull(), "can't push a full stack" );

        storage[ top++ ] = item;
    }

    public T pop() {
        checkPrecondition( isEmpty(), "can't pop an empty stack" );

        return (T) storage[ --top ];
    }

    public T peek() {
        checkPrecondition( isEmpty(), "can't peek an empty stack" );

        return (T) storage[ --top ];
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals( final Object that ) {
        if ( this == that )
            return true;

        if ( that == null || !getClass().equals( that.getClass() ) )
            return false;

        final Stack&lt;?&gt; other = (Stack&lt;?&gt;) that;
        return top == other.top && Arrays.deepEquals( storage, other.storage );
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        int hashValue = 17;
        hashValue = 37 * hashValue + top;
        hashValue = 37 * hashValue + Arrays.deepHashCode( storage );

        return hashValue;
    }

    private void checkPrecondition( final boolean precondition, final String message ) {
        if ( !precondition )
            throw new IllegalStateException( message );
    }

    private boolean isEmpty() {
        return top == 0;
    }

    private boolean isFull() {
        return top == storage.length;
    }
}

This yields the following warnings when compiled (Sun <code>javac</code> 1.5.0_06):
</p>
<pre>
    [javac] C:\java\scratchpad\src\pholser\util\Stack.java:16: warning: [unchecked] unchecked cast
    [javac] found   : java.lang.Object
    [javac] required: T
    [javac]         final T currentTop = (T) storage[ top ];

    [javac]         return (T) storage[ --top ];

    [javac] C:\java\scratchpad\src\pholser\util\Stack.java:34: warning: [unchecked] unchecked cast

    [javac]         return (T) storage[ --top ];
</pre>
<p>
Note that each of the casts we attempt should be legitimate; if Java's type system is sound, there should be nothing but elements of at least type <code>T</code> in the <code>Stack</code>'s storage.
</p>
<p>
I then attempted to suppress the warnings by applying the <code>@SuppressWarnings( "unchecked" )</code> annotation to various elements of the class.  Firstly, applying it to the class itself should do the trick:
</p>
<pre>
@SuppressWarnings( "unchecked" )
public class Stack&lt;T&gt; {
</pre>
<p>
Sure enough, no warnings.  However, to quote the javadoc for <code>@SuppressWarnings</code>:
</p>
<blockquote>
As a matter of style, programmers should always use this annotation on the most deeply nested element where it is effective. If you want to suppress a warning in a particular method, you should annotate that method rather than its class.
</blockquote>
<p>
Fair enough.  Tacking the annotation on the declarations of <code>pop()</code> and <code>peek()</code>:
</p>
<pre>
@SuppressWarnings( "unchecked" )
    public T pop() {

@SuppressWarnings( "unchecked" )
    public T peek() {
</pre>
<p>
suppresses the warnings on those methods.  We should do the same for the "copy" constructor:
</p>
<pre>
@SuppressWarnings( "unchecked" )
    public Stack( final Stack&lt;T&gt; other ) {
</pre>
<p>
Golden.  It's nice to be able to apply <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> to so many different kinds of program elements.  We've seen it applied so far at the class, method, and constructor level.
</p>
<p>
By un-inlining ("out-lining?") the return values of <code>pop()</code> and <code>peek()</code>, and the local <code>currentTop</code> in the "copy" constructor, we can show off application of <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> on locals:
</p>
<pre>
        @SuppressWarnings( "unchecked" )
        final T currentTop = (T) storage[ top ];

        @SuppressWarnings( "unchecked" )
        final T returnValue = (T) storage[ --top ];
        return returnValue;
</pre>
<p>
Would an astute reader be so kind as to augment this example to demonstrate how <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> can effectively stifle "unchecked"-flavored warnings on fields or parameters?  Marking the <code>that</code> parameter of <code>Stack.equals()</code> and then attempting a dubious cast of <code>that</code> to <code>Stack&lt;T&gt;</code> didn't stifle the warning.  Also, marking field <code>storage</code> didn't prevent warnings, perhaps because the program element in question in <code>pop()</code>, <code>peek()</code>, and the copy ctor is an element of an array field, not the array field itself.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="http://jaggregate.sourceforge.net">Jaggregate</a> there were a few spots in the code that were generating "unchecked"-flavored warnings--about 20 or so--even though it was demonstrable that the code was correct and would not lead to bad casts.  Once <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> became supported in Java 5 update 6, I undertook an effort to eliminate and/or suppress the remaining warnings.  I found that pretty much all of these warnings were in places where I was attempting a cast to a generic type.  Marking methods and local variables with <code>@SuppressWarnings( "unchecked" )</code> did the trick but seemed to clutter up the code quite a bit.  So, I refactored the casts to a method:
</p>
<pre>
    class Objects {
        @SuppressWarnings( "unchecked" )
        static &lt;T&gt; T cast( final Object target ) {
            return (T) target;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
Now <em>that's</em> minimizing the scope of the suppression.  8^)
</p>
<p>
So now, instead of:
</p>
<pre>
    @SuppressWarnings( "unchecked" )
    private void repopulateBucket( final Object bucket ) {
        for ( Node&lt;K, V&gt; node = (Node&lt;K, V&gt;) bucket;
            node != null;
            node = node.nextNode ) {

            put( node.key(), node.value() );
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
or
</p>
<pre>
    private void repopulateBucket( final Object bucket ) {
        for ( @SuppressWarnings( "unchecked" ) Node&lt;K, V&gt; node = (Node&lt;K, V&gt;) bucket;
            node != null;
            node = node.nextNode ) {

            put( node.key(), node.value() );
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
we have:
</p>
<pre>
    private void repopulateBucket( final Object bucket ) {
        for ( Node&lt;K, V&gt; node = Objects.cast( bucket );
            node != null;
            node = node.nextNode ) {

            put( node.key(), node.value() );
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
Note how the type inference on generic methods really helps--we don't have to tell the compiler what we want to cast to, it's kind of a no-brainer in this case.  In other cases, especially when trying to cast to a type specified by a type parameter, you have to give the compiler a hint:
</p>
<pre>
    public E at( final int index ) {
        checkIndexIsValid( index, "search" );

        return Objects.&lt;E&gt;cast( storage[ index ] );
    }
</pre>
<p>
It's not crystal clear to me what are the exact circumstances that require the extra hint, but in any event I was able to suppress the warnings in the Jaggregate code with a minimum of clutter.
