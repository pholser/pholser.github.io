<p>Every software developer who's tired of being called a "resource," raise your hand.</p>

<p>I can scarcely think of a more dehumanizing way to label someone that you'd like to think was hired because of their intelligence, creativity, and motivation in solving software problems, rather than for their resemblance to a lump of coal, gallon of gasoline, or bag of Fritos (thanks, David Nunn, for the Frito analogy).</p>
