<p>Often when I go to run a <a href="http://junit.org">JUnit</a> test from <a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> via a context menu on the test class from the Package Explorer, I find myself looking for the &quot;Run as JUnit Test&quot; item under <strong>&quot;Team...&quot;</strong> rather than <strong>&quot;Run As...&quot;</strong>. It&#39;s as though subconsciously I&#39;m saying that the act of writing and running these tests is for more than just my benefit.</p><p>A couple of other notes on Eclipse:</p><ol>
<li>Create a less complicated key binding for running JUnit tests -- I use <strong>Ctrl+U</strong>. Much easier than the out-of-the-box jazz piano chord (<strong>Alt+Shift+X, T</strong>).</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://improvingworks.com/products/infinitest/eclipse/">Infinitest</a>, and you&#39;ll come to think of <strong>&quot;Save All&quot;</strong> as &quot;Run all the tests and tell me what the effects of these changes are.&quot; Rapid feedback FTW.</li>
</ol>
