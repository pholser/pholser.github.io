<p>I've taken to pronouncing the Java generics wildcard character as &quot;huh?&quot;.&nbsp; So that:</p>

<p><code>List&lt;? extends Comparable&lt;?&gt;&gt;</code></p>

<p>is pronounced &quot;List of huh? extends Comparable of huh?&quot;.</p>

<p>I've also been doing the equivalent of finger-quoting when pronouncing these expressions, doing angle brackets with my fingers on either side of my head as I say the stuff that's in angle brackets.</p>

<p>I simply must work these into a presentation sometime...</p>
