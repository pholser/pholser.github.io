<blockquote><p>&quot;A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.&quot;<br />-- Ralph Waldo Emerson, &quot;Self-Reliance&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>I haven't read the essay, so I'm not sure whether in it Emerson tries to explain the difference between foolish and wise consistency. So, at the risk of being labelled a fool, here are some programming consistencies which I'll toss out there as &quot;wise&quot;.</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Consistency in code spacing, indentation, and naming.</em> Apart from the benefits your team reaps from having a code base that looks as though it were written by one person, you'll have the satisfaction of creating code like a professional. Who'd want to buy, or even borrow, a book with inconsistent spacing, indentation, capitalization, spelling, typography...? I have my preferences for coding conventions, but if they clash with the consensus of my team, I'll do as the Romans do.</li>
<li><em>Consistency in build process</em>. I'm a huge fan of continuous integration. I'm also a huge fan of everyone on the team building the project using the same build scripts the continuous build would; not everyone hopefully getting their IDEs configured the same way and building via the IDE.</li>
<li><em>Consistently writing automated behavior specifications for the code, as the code is being developed.</em> Call them &quot;tests&quot; if you must, but I'm really into treating xUnit tests as a design tool, as a crucible in which to fire and shape design ideas. No more of this post-facto, horrendously duplication-riddled test script cranking. Treat your automated &quot;tests&quot; as first-class citizens, creating and maintaining them with as much care as you would the code it's exercising.</li>
</ul>

<p>What programming consistencies do you find wise? Foolish?</p>
