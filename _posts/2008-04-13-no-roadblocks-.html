<p>Don't let your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)">Scrum</a> go stale.</p>

<p>At work, &quot;No roadblocks&quot; had become not just the answer to the third Scrum question, but almost a sort of punctuation to let the team know that the current pig is done speaking (useful, perhaps, for the team members participating via conference call).&nbsp; Maybe this is a good problem to have, no one having any roadblocks.&nbsp; But it could also be that your team isn't talking about the tough issues confronting it, especially if correlated with declining velocity or other indicators.</p>

<p>We ended up tweaking the questions a bit -- the third question is now something along the lines of &quot;Do I need any help completing a task and/or am I available to help with the completion of another task?&quot;</p>

<p>(It's still kind of fun to say &quot;No roadblocks&quot; at the end of a rant at lunch, and such.&nbsp; 8^))</p>
