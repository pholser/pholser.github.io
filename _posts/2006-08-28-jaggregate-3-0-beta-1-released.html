<p><a href="http://jaggregate.sourceforge.net">Jaggregate</a> is a generics-aware collections library that is modeled after the <a href="http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/squeak/uploads/172/standard_v1_9-indexed.pdf">ANSI Smalltalk</a> collection protocol. See the changes <a href="http://jaggregate.sourceforge.net/changes.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Rest assured that <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/ahe/resource/closures.pdf">if closures are to become part of the core Java language</a>, Jaggregate will support closures as functors and predicates.</p>
