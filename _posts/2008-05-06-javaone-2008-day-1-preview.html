<p>I'm at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/index.jsp">JavaOne</a> this year, my first trip to the big dance.&nbsp; Based on the rock-concert lines forming for the first General Session, I'd say the conference is doing pretty damn well.</p>

<p>Flight into SFO from DFW last night was without incident.&nbsp; It was remarkably easy to get to my hotel downtown, about six blocks away from the Moscone Center -- hopped the AirTrain to the BART Station, quickly purchased a ticket to the Powell station, hopped on, and twenty minutes or so I was five blocks away from my hotel.&nbsp; Great success!</p>

<p>I'm registered for the following Day 1 technical sessions/BOFs:</p>

<ul><li> &quot;<a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org">JRuby</a>: Why, What, How...Do It Now&quot;, featuring the great <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com">Charles Nutter</a> </li>

<li>&quot;More <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/">Effective Java</a>&quot; from Mr. <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/">Effective Java</a> himself, Joshua Bloch</li>

<li>&quot;Upcoming Java Programming Language Changes&quot;, featuring <a href="http://gafter.blogspot.com">Neal Gafter</a>, he of all things Java-compiler-related</li>

<li>&quot;Practical Applications of Static Java Technology-Based Bytecode Analysis and Transformation&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;Tips and Tricks for Using Language Features in API Design and Implementation&quot; -- perhaps some good thoughts there about fluent interfaces</li>

<li>&quot;Migrating to <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven 2</a> Demystified&quot;.&nbsp; I am in the midst of doing this for my <a href="http://jopt-simple.sourceforge.net">Java open</a> <a href="http://jaggregate.sourceforge.net">source projects</a>, so perhaps I can pick up some tips.</li>

<li>&quot;GUI Testing Made Easy&quot;, with <a href="http://www.jroller.com/alexRuiz/">Alex Ruiz</a> and Yvonne Price of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fest/">FEST</a>.&nbsp; Alex and I met each other briefly while both at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> -- it'll be good to see what he's been up to.</li></ul>

<p>More updates as the talks warrant.</p>
