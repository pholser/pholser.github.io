<p>If you're a programmer faced with the prospect of maintaining an existing system, and if <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052">&quot;code is your house and you have to live in it&quot;</a>, then for goodness's sake do a walk-through, do an inspection before moving in. Do whatever is necessary for you to decide whether the situation will be livable for you. Get a sense of whether you're getting into a sweet new pad or a real &quot;fixer-upper.&quot; How many unit tests are there? What is the average cyclomatic complexity per method? Methods per class? Lines per method? Who lived here before? Where are they now? Why?</p>

<p>What other questions should you ask in this sort of situation?</p>
