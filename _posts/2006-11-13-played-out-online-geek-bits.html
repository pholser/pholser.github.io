<p>Herewith, some patterns of online communication that, in my opinion, have <a href="http://jumptheshark.com/">jumped the shark</a>. I'm excluding the obvious targets that are emoticons, ubiquitous abbreviations (LOL, etc.)...these are a bit more geek-oriented.</p>

<ul><li>&quot;[insert-technology-here] and [insert-another-technology-here] and [insert-still-another-technology-here]...Oh my!&quot; Wasn't even cute in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0032138/">The Wizard of Oz</a>.</li>

<li>Overcapitalization and overtrademarking, as in &quot;Rails is the <strong>N</strong>ext <strong>B</strong>ig <strong>T</strong>hing<strong>™©®</strong>.&quot;</li>

<li>Fake typing blunders indicated by visual backspaces, e.g. &quot;Mephistoph^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HMicrosoft Internet Explorer&quot; or &quot;Time to go meet with Lumbergh^Wmy boss.&quot;</li>

<li>Being the first, or at least &quot;for one&quot;, to welcome our <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/000399.html">new [insert-thingy-here] overlords</a>.</li></ul>

<p>What phrases or other online gimmickry would you shave days off the end of your life never to hear again?</p>
