<p><a href="http://jaggregate.sourceforge.net">Jaggregate</a> is a Java 5 collections library that is inspired by the ANSI Smalltalk collection protocols.&nbsp; There are probably some generics relaxations that can happen in subsequent releases, plus predicate algebra, read/write streams....Please have a look, I'd love to hear your feedback!</p>
