<pre>using NUnit.Framework;
namespace Pholser {
  [TestFixture]
  public abstract class AbstractTestFixture {
    [TestFixtureSetUp]
    protected virtual void FixtureTearDown() {
    }
    [SetUp]
    protected virtual void SetUp() {
    }
    [TearDown]
    protected virtual void TearDown() {
    }
    [TestFixtureTearDown]
    protected virtual void FixtureTearDown() {
    }
  }
}</pre>

<p>The neat part is that since NUnit's attributes are inherited, the subclass doesn't have to be marked with [TestFixture], and if it overrides the fixture methods doesn't have to annotate the overrides (except, of course, with the <strong>override</strong> keyword...grrr...)</p>

<p>I know it's cool that NUnit doesn't force you to extend a class in order to write tests, but in the interest of removing duplication in your test suite you may find yourself gravitating toward some sort of base fixture class.</p>

<p>One point of interest: NUnit creates one instance of the [TestFixture] to be used by all the [Test] methods on it, unlike JUnit, which gives each testFoo() method its own fixture instance to run on.  Hopefully you're writing your tests in such a way that the distinction never matters...</p>
