<p><a href="http://jopt-simple.sourceforge.net">JOpt Simple</a> is my Java library for parsing command-line options.&#0160; Release 2.4 sports some bug fixes, internal reorganization, some new features such as option synonymy and a cleaned-up help printing facility.&#0160; JOpt Simple seems to be generating more interest over time -- I&#39;m glad it&#39;s helping programmers out with an uncomplicated API and more-than-adequate feature set.</p>
